abstract = {How are the meanings of individual words combined to form a more global description of meaning? This paper describes a phenomenon which sheds some light on one aspect of this process. Consider the following question: How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark? Most people answer “two” even though they know quite well that it was Noah and not Moses who sailed the Ark. This illusion occurs even when time pressure is eliminated and subjects are told that questions may be “wrong” and given an example of a question with an inconsistent name in it. Two explanations of this illusion—that people are skipping over the name or that the focus of the question is leading them astry—are eliminated. Results indicate that it is important that the inconsistent name share semantic features with the correct name. An explanation of the illusion is developed.}

        abstract = {Humans make countless decisions every day and inevitably make mistakes. One origin of such errors are cognitive illusions involving flaws in memory, judgment, or perception. On the one hand, they serve to shed light on the functioning of the human cognitive system, but on the other hand, they can also have negative consequences such as stereotyping or misinformation. In this dissertation, I will focus on two specific cognitive illusions and attempt to attenuate them: First, the Moses illusion, in which people read a distorted question with one term replaced by a semantically related but incorrect term, yet fail to notice this distortion and respond to the question as if it were correct. Second, the truth effect, in which people rate repeated judgments as truer than non-repeated judgments. By reviewing the existing literature, I show that among all the investigated possible moderators to weaken the effect, one approach has been largely missing: motivation. In six chapters, I investigate providing monetary incentives for correct responses (for the Moses illusion and the truth effect) and the relevance of statements presented (for the truth effect) as ways to increase motivation and attenuate both cognitive illusions. However, all motivational manipulations result in little attenuation at best (if any). I discuss the possible reasons for the failed attenuation and propose a combined approach for attenuation that includes both a motivational manipulation as well as teaching effective strategies to avoid cognitive illusions.},
